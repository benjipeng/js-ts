# Callbacks

> In JavaScript, functions are `"first-class citizens"`. This means they can be treated like any other variable: they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from functions.

A **callback function** is just a function that is passed as an argument to another function, with the intention of being "called back" (, or executed) at some later time.
